# Hotel-Revenue-Data-Analysis

## Background

The dataset used in this analysis is an open source dataset in kaggle and can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/govindkrishnadas/hotel-revenue). It contains various information about hotel booking from 2018 - 2020, along with additional tables containing market segment information and meal costs.


### Business Case: 
A business manager of a chain of hotel would like to request help from the data analytics team to develop a dashboard to analyze & visualize hotel booking data.


### The business manager is interested if there are any patterns/ seasonality with respect to:
1) Guests
2) Revenue
   
### Requirement: 
Build a Dashboard using PowerBI to provide at-a-glance information about features that are relevant to revenue.

### Result:
Data from raw .csv file was ingested into MySQL, from which SQL queries were iteratively built upon to obtain the final output which was then imported into SSMS for data analysis & visualization. Additional data processing was done in PowerBI for visualization purposes.

Guests, revenue seasonality, and recommendations for hotel arrangement were explained with the help of additional visualizations done in the PowerBI dashboard.
